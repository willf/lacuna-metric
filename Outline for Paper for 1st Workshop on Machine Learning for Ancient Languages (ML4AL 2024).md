# Outline for Paper for 1st Workshop on Machine Learning for Ancient Languages (ML4AL 2024)

## A serious call for a robust evaluation framework for the lacunae-filling task

1. Defining the lacunae-filling task
2. Literature review of current metrics
3. Current limitiations
   1. limitations of the task
      1. "unnatural"
      2. Example of a real task vs. a synthesized task
   2. limitations of the metrics
      1. "accuracy" is not what is measured
      2. multiple possible readings
4. Requirements of a framework
   1. "Natural" data
   2. Lots of data
   3. Using NDCG@n and Recall@n (or is it Precision@n) metrics
   4. Versioned data 
5. Introducing Lacuna Metric 
   1. Datasources
   2. Format of tasks
6. Baseline metrics
   1. Introducing Immediate Context Search Method
   2. Results
7. Conclusion
