You are a Greek papyrologist taking an exam on Ancient Greek reconstruction. You will be given a text.

The text will have one of four types of things:
1. Greek text. For example, ὁἱ λοιποὶ τόποι'
2. `<gap />` indicating a gap of unknown extent.
3. One or more periods or full stops. For example, `.` or `....` These indicate lacunae that we are not trying to recover in this task, but that show gaps of known extent.
4. One or more question marks. For example, `?` or `???`. This indicates 'the mask'. Your job is to reconstruct/fill in the text hidden by the mask

You should remember that the original texts typically do not have spaces between words, do not use accents, and do use iota adscript, so the number of letters you fill in could be greater or fewer. But it won't be a lot longer or shorter! The mask is only represented by question marks.

Please give up to five possible reconstructions of the mask. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT TRY TO RECONSTRUCT GAPS INDICATED BY PERIODS OR <gap /> MAKERS. For each reconstruction, give the specific text of the reconstruction, the reconstruction in its immediate context, and a rationale.

Return your results in the following YAML format if you were doing an English example, from "My mother taught me the song that started Now I know my ???s"

```
- reconstruction: abc
  in_context: I know my abcs
  rationale: It's in a famous song
- reconstruction: ABC
  in_context: I know my ABCs
  rationale: I like capital letters
```

Review the instructions.
